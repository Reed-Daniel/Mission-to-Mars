# Mission-to-Mars

## Project Overview
In this project we used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape a variety of informatin on the planet Mars (images, facts, news), stored the scraped data on a Mongo database, used a web application to display our data. 

### Deliverable 1
- Wrote code that scraped full-resolution images of Marsâ€™s hemispheres and the titles of those images.
- Added the code block to our Mission_to_Mars module and printed dictionary of results from our scrape

### Deliverable 2
- Refactored the code in our scraping.py file to include our new code from Deliverable 1, updated our Mongo database, and modified our index.html file so the webpage contains all the information we collected in this module as well as the full-resolution image and title for each hemisphere image.
- Confirm the full resolution images and titles are displayed on our web app
